Insights: Students consistently reported that Professor Rand's grading rubric was unclear, leading to unexpectedly low grades despite significant effort.  While appreciating his helpful in-class support and engaging lectures, many felt his high expectations and philosophy-focused grading were overly rigorous for a 100-level course, resulting in frustration and a sense of unfairness.

Recommendation: To address student concerns, Professor Rand should provide more explicit and detailed grading criteria for papers, perhaps including examples of high-quality work.  While maintaining high academic standards, he could consider adjusting the rigor of assignments to better align with a 100-level course, perhaps offering more scaffolding or opportunities for revision, thereby making the learning process less stressful.  This would allow him to maintain the enthusiasm for the subject he clearly possesses and benefit his students who work hard.
